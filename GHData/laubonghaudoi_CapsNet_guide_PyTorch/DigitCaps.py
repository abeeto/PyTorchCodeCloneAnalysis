    The `DigitCaps` layer consists of 10 16D capsules. Compared to the traditional
    scalar output neurons in fully connected networks(FCN), the `DigitCaps` layer
    can be seen as an FCN with ten 16-dimensional output neurons, which we call
    these neurons "capsules".

    In this layer, we take the input `[1152, 8]` tensor `u` as 1152 [8,] vectors
    `u_i`, each `u_i` is a 8D output of the capsules from `PrimaryCaps` (see Eq.2
    in Section 2, Page 2) and sent to the 10 capsules. For each capsule, the tensor
    is first transformed by `W_ij`s into [1152, 16] size. Then we perform the Dynamic
    Routing algorithm to get the output `v_j` of size [16,]. As there are 10 capsules,
    the final output is [16, 10] size.

    #### Dimension transformation in this layer(ignoring `batch_size`):
    [1152, 8] --> [1152, 16] --> [1, 16] x 10 capsules --> [10, 16] output

    Note that in our codes we have vectorized these computations, so the dimensions
    above are just for understanding, actual dimensions of tensors are different.

        There is only one parameter in this layer, `W` [1, 1152, 10, 16, 8], where
        every [8, 16] is a weight matrix W_ij in Eq.2, that is, there are 11520
        `W_ij`s in total.

        The the coupling coefficients `b` [64, 1152, 10, 1] is a temporary variable which
        does NOT belong to the layer's parameters. In other words, `b` is not updated
        by gradient back-propagations. Instead, we update `b` by Dynamic Routing
        in every forward propagation. See the docstring of `self.forward` for details.

        In this layer, we vectorize our computations by calling `W` and using
        `torch.matmul()`. Thus the full computaion steps are as follows.
            1. Expand `W` into batches and compute `u_hat` (Eq.2)
            2. Line 2: Initialize `b` into zeros
            3. Line 3: Start Routing for `r` iterations:
                1. Line 4: c = softmax(b)
                2. Line 5: s = sum(c * u_hat)
                3. Line 6: v = squash(s)
                4. Line 7: b += u_hat * v

        The coupling coefficients `b` can be seen as a kind of attention matrix
        in the attentional sequence-to-sequence networks, which is widely used in
        Neural Machine Translation systems. For tutorials on  attentional seq2seq
        models, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01619 or
