# # Style Transfer with Deep Neural Networks In PyTorch
# 
# 
# In this project, I recreated a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch.
# 
# In the paper, style transfer uses the features found in the 19-layer VGG Network, which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and a few fully-connected layers. Conv_1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack. Conv_2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the *second* stack. The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv_5_4.

# ### Separating Style and Content
# 
# Style transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, my aim is to create a new, _target_ image which will contain my desired content and style components:
# * objects and their arrangement are similar to that of the **content image**
# * style, colors, and textures are similar to that of the **style image**
# In this project, I'll use a pre-trained VGG19 Net to extract content or style features from a passed in image. I'll then formalize the idea of content and style _losses_ and use those to iteratively update my target image until I get a result that I want.

# * `vgg19.features`, which are all the convolutional and pooling layers
# * `vgg19.classifier`, which are the three linear, classifier layers at the end

# With the helper function below I can load in any type and size of image. The `load_image` function also converts images to normalized Tensors.

# * Reshape that tensor so that the spatial dimensions are flattened
# * Calculate the gram matrix by multiplying the reshaped tensor by it's transpose

# *Note: You can multiply two matrices using `torch.mm(matrix1, matrix2)`.*

# ## Loss and Weights
#

#

# #### Content and Style Weight
# 
# Just like in the paper, I define an alpha (`content_weight`) and a beta (`style_weight`). This ratio will affect how _stylized_ my final image is. It's recommended I leave the content_weight = 1 and set the style_weight to achieve the ratio I want.

# weighting earlier layers more will result in *larger* style artifacts
# notice I am excluding `conv4_2` my content representation

content_weight = 1  # alpha

# ## Updating the Target & Calculating Losses
# #### Content Loss
# 
# The content loss will is the mean squared difference between the target and content features at layer `conv4_2`. This can be calculated as follows:
# ```
# content_loss = torch.mean((target_features['conv4_2'] - content_features['conv4_2'])**2)
# ```
# 
# #### Style Loss
# 
# The style loss is calculated in a similar way, only I have to iterate through a number of layers, specified by name in my dictionary `style_weights`.
# > I'll calculate the gram matrix for the target image, `target_gram` and style image `style_gram` at each of those layers and compare those gram matrices, calculating the `layer_style_loss`.
# > Later, this value is normalized by the size of the layer.
# 
# #### Total Loss
# 
# Finally, I'll create the total loss by adding up the style and content losses and weighting them with my specified alpha and beta!
