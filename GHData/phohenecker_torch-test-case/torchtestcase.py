    PyTorch classes.
    
    ``TorchTestCase`` provides the following PyTorch-specific functionality:
    * ``assertEqual`` supports all kinds of PyTorch tensors as well as instances of ``torch.nn.Parameter`` and
      ``torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence``.
    * ``assertGreater``, ``assertGreaterEqual``, ``assertLess``, and ``assertLessEqual`` support all kinds of PyTorch
      tensors except ``CharTensor``s as well as instances of ``torch.nn.Parameter``.
      Furthermore, these assertions allow for comparing tensors to numbers. Notice, however, that neither of the
      mentioned assertions performs any kind of type check in the sense that it is possible to compare a
      ``FloatTensor`` with a ``Parameter``, for example.
