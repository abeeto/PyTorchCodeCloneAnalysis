DDPG (Actor-Critic) RL Example for Unity ML-Agents Environments using PyTorch
Includes examples of the following DDPG training algorithms:

The example uses a modified version of the Unity ML-Agents Reacher Example Environment.
The environment includes In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. 
A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. 
Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many 
time steps as possible.

STEP 1: Set the Training Parameters
======
        num_episodes (int): maximum number of training episodes
        episode_scores (float): list to record the scores obtained from each episode
        scores_average_window (int): the window size employed for calculating the average score (e.g. 100)
        solved_score (float): the average score required for the environment to be considered solved

solved_score = 30

STEP 2: Start the Unity Environment
# Use the corresponding call depending on your operating system

env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Reacher.app")
# - **Mac**: "Banana_Mac/Reacher.app"
# - **Windows** (x86): "Reacher_Windows_x86/Reacher.exe"

STEP 3: Get The Unity Environment Brian
Unity ML-Agent applications or Environments contain "BRAINS" which are responsible for deciding 
the actions an agent or set of agents should take given a current set of environment (state) 
observations. The Reacher environment has a single Brian, thus, we just need to access the first brain 
available (i.e., the default brain). We then set the default brain as the brain that will be controlled.
"""
# Get the default brain 
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]

# Assign the default brain as the brain to be controlled
brain = env.brains[brain_name]


"""
#############################################
STEP 4: Determine the size of the Action and State Spaces and the Number of Agents

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to
position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. 
Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque 
applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should 
be a number between -1 and 1.

The reacher environment can contain multiple agents in the environment to increase training time. 
To use multiple (active) training agents we need to know how many there are.
"""

# Set the number of actions or action size
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size

# Set the size of state observations or state size
state_size = brain.vector_observation_space_size

# Get number of agents in Environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)
print('\nNumber of Agents: ', num_agents)


"""
###################################
STEP 5: Create a DDPG Agent from the Agent Class in ddpg_agent.py
A DDPG agent initialized with the following parameters.
    ======
    state_size (int): dimension of each state (required)
    action_size (int): dimension of each action (required)
    num_agents (int): number of agents in the unity environment
    seed (int): random seed for initializing training point (default = 0)

Here we initialize an agent using the Unity environments state and action size and number of Agents
determined above.
"""
agent = Agent(state_size=state_size, action_size=action_size, num_agents=num_agents, random_seed=0)


"""
###################################
STEP 6: Run the DDPG Training Sequence
The DDPG Training Process involves the agent learning from repeated episodes of behaviour 
to map states to actions the maximize rewards received via environmental interaction.

The agent training process involves the following:
(1) Reset the environment at the beginning of each episode.
(2) Obtain (observe) current state, s, of the environment at time t
(3) Perform an action, a(t), in the environment given s(t)
(4) Observe the result of the action in terms of the reward received and 
	the state of the environment at time t+1 (i.e., s(t+1))
(5) Update agent memory and learn from experience (i.e, agent.step)
(6) Update episode score (total reward received) and set s(t) -> s(t+1).
(7) If episode is done, break and repeat from (1), otherwise repeat from (3).

Below we also exit the training process early if the environment is solved. 
That is, if the average score for the previous 100 episodes is greater than solved_score.
