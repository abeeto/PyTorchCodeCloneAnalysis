What is PyTorch?
================

It’s a Python-based scientific computing package targeted at two sets of
audiences:

-  A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs
-  a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility
   and speed

Tensors
^^^^^^^

Tensors are similar to NumPy’s ndarrays, with the addition being that
Tensors can also be used on a GPU to accelerate computing.
