The purpose of this script is to ensure the four functions included in this package are functioning properly and as an example of use for the user. 
It currently only provides checks for the inline geometry with the fluid at a Reynolds number of 22000.

The expected output is:
Zhukauskas: dP_1 = 21.94 kPa
Gaddis-Gnielinski: dP 2 = 25.67 kPa
Zhukauskas: Nu1 = 142.52
Gaddis-Gnielinski: Nu2 = 147.31
