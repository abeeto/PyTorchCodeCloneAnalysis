# spot on!
# this illustrates how networks can learn arbitrary functions,
# in this case -- extremely arbitrary, we learned random data!
# keep this in mind as you are doing machine learning on real data
# -- networks are powerful enough to fix nearly any data, including
# random, which means in effect the algorithm memorized the 
# inputs in a kind of sophisticated mathematical hashtable
# -- when this happens, we call it overfitting -- meaning
# the model knows only the inputs it is trained on and cannot
# deal with previously unseen inputs -- think about this 
# when you make your models!
