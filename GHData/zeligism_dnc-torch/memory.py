        Args:
        `Interface` is a dictionary of of tensors that describe how the memory
        should be updated and how the data should be retrieved and written.

        The names of each tensor in the interface is
        the following (batch dimension not included):

        A memory update also updates the internal state of the memory.
        The state of the memory contains (batch dimension not included):
                names                 dim

        6) usage              (memory_size)

        A memory update can be divided into these steps:
        1) Read interface vector (the tensors are passed by DNC).
        2) Update current usage using free_gate.
        3) Find allocation weighting by using the usage vector
            and the content-based weightings for the write heads.
        4) Calculate write_weights by finding a write content weighting first,
            by using content-based addressing function C for the weight_keys.
            Next, we use write_gate, allocation_gate, allocation weightings,
            and write content weightings to find write_weights.
        5) Update memory by using erase_vectors and write_vectors.
        6) Update link matrix. See `update_linkage()` for more details.
        7) Calculate content-based read addresses,
            and then update read weights, which depends on content-addressing
            as well as link matrix (forward/backward linkage read weights).
            We interpolate between these three modes to get the final read weights.
        8) Update the state of the DNC (note that `self` still has `t-1` state).
        9) Return the words read from memory by the read heads.
