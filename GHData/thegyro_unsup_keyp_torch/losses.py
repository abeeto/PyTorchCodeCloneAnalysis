    If two keypoints move along trajectories that are identical up to a time-
    invariant translation (offset), this suggest that they both represent the same
    object and are redundant, which we want to avoid.

    To measure this similarity of trajectories, we first center each trajectory by
    subtracting its mean. Then, we compute the pairwise distance between all
    trajectories at each timepoint. These distances are higher for trajectories
    that are less similar. To compute the loss, the distances are transformed by
    a Gaussian and averaged across time and across trajectories.
